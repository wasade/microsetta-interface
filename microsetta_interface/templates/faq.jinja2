            The Microsetta Initiative (TMI) is an extension of the American Gut
            and British Gut Projects with the specific aims of being globally
            inclusive and accommodating a broader range of microbiome sample
            types.   The American Gut and British Gut Project both still
            operate through The Microsetta Initiative as regional projects,
            making TMI the central hub for providing kits to participants and
            hosting the participant website.

                In response to COVID-19, USPS deliveries have been reduced to our laboratory that runs from
                UC San Diego. We are working closely with UC San Diego Shipping and Logistics to ensure samples are
                delivered with minimal delay. All British Gut samples will be held at their site until they have
                resumed normal operations, and they are able to bulk ship samples back to us. Due to these delays,
                there may also be a longer waiting period for notifications regarding when your sample has been
                received by our lab.  Any samples we receive are placed in temperature-controlled freezers to ensure
                sample quality is maintained.
                <br>
                <br>
                If your sample has been sent via FedEx (new Microsetta kits), transit times from impacted areas might be
                increased, but sample quality won’t be affected.

                <br>
                The kit ID is located on the kit registration card, found in the slot for Step 2 in your kit (please see the image below):

                <i>IMPORTANT:</i> If your registration card contains a "Password", as displayed in the image above, please the associated password. This is for our old website that is no longer online.
                <br>

                card, please email <a href="mailto:microsetta@ucsd.edu">microsetta@ucsd.edu</a> and provide one of the
                barcode numbers found on your collection materials, such as the
                number found on the sticky label on the silver specimen bag
                (the barcode number would start with leading zeros)

                <u>Questions on Sample Collection</u>
                <br>
                <b>I did not get enough blood on the swabs.  What can I do?</b>
                <br>
                <i>If at least one swab was saturated with blood:</i> Proceed with sending your sample back to us; we will still be able to utilize it for analysis.
                <br>
                <i>If neither swab was saturated with blood and your lancet is used:</i> Contact us at <a href="mailto:microsetta@ucsd.edu">microsetta@ucsd.edu</a>, stating that you need a new lancet and provide your mailing address.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>How do I use the two tubes provided in the kit? Which is my saliva swab?</b>
                <br>
                Each tube provided in your kit is meant to be used for taking either a fecal and saliva sample (i.e. one sample type per tube).  For the fecal sample, you will take the swabs, collect a sample, and place the swabs in the tube.  For the saliva sample, you will spit inside the tube.  Check the instruction brochure for detailed steps.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Why is there an extra set of swabs?</b>
                <br>
                Please only use one set of swabs to take your fecal sample.  The additional set was a packaging error and does not need to be used.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>How do I take 2mL of saliva?</b>
                <br>
                As the tubes do not currently have a mark for 2mL, please estimate this by filling up the tube about less than halfway with your saliva.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>I took a different sample type than what was requested.</b>
                <br>
                If only one of your samples was the incorrect sample type,
                please proceed with sending them back.  While we may not
                process your sample immediately, there will be follow-ups as
                part of the project, so we will collect additional samples at a
                later point in time.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Where is the FedEx shipping label for pickup?</b>
                <br>
                <i>For CTS participants:</i> If your Microsetta kit <b>DID NOT</b> contain a shipping label, please
